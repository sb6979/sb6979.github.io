        <h1>Welcome To My Website ~Shania</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Shania. I am currently 15 years old, and I go to Uncommon Charter High School. I am also a rising sophmore! I do not know exactly what I become when I grow up, but there is a couple of things that I like to do. For example,I am interested in computer science, art, and instruments. When I was in middle school, I unfortunatley did not have a computer science class. So it was something that I was interested in, but I did not have access to the equipment. But in 7th grade, a computer science teacher came to my school abd presented a program that she's in, and it's called "Girls who code". After that class period, that is where my love for computer science grew. But even better, I found out what part of computer science I loved: Coding. Last year, I applied to a STEM program that offered me education that included coding. I learned so much from that program. I learned what a bread board was, and I learned how to connect it to a computer and make LED lights light up. That experience is one that I will never forget. This year, I am currently in a program called Computer Science for Cyber Security. In this program, I have learned many things. As an example, I learned that HTML is a markup language, and a standard system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects. I also learned what HTML CSS is. CSS stands for Casading Style Sheets, and CSS can be added to HTML elements in three ways. Inline, Internal, and External. Another thing that I have learned thus far is that computers use encryption for private information. Basically encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
